        <p>In 2009 Bitcoin was released as the first modern cryptocurrency, a year later  in 2010
            2 young men bought a pizza for <span class="green">10,000</span> bitcoin worth just
            <span class="green">41$</span> then but worth <span class="green">680,000,000$</span>
            at the highest price of bitcoin.
        </p>
        <p>We can talk about how it was a horrible purchase in hindsight but how were they supposed to know
            how big crypto has gotten in recent years?</p>
        <p>In just a few decades, people have been able to revolutionize their financial situation with the 
            emergence of cryptocurruncies.</p>
        <p>Despite the now main stream appeal of crypto, there still wasn't a presence of crypto in the UCLA club
            sphere. That's why we're here.
        </p>
        <p>We're looking to fill a void and revolutionize what a club is at the same time, it doesn't need to be
            a time-commitment, drop by the site at any time to play the simulation and see how you stack up against
            the rest of UCLA while learning more about crypto.
